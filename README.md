This repository applies the [model developed by Timothy W. Russell](https://github.com/thimotei/covid_underreporting)
to estimate COVID-19 underascertainment to data from Uruguay. The original model was modified to take
into account the age structure of reported cases, as well as to use reported hospitalizations and
ICU admissions, instead of just deaths.
